	1. init_state
		the initial state of the 8 puzzle, from first digit at first row, first column
		(use 0 to represent blank)
		Example:

		Consider the puzzle

		3 4 7
		6 1 8
		  5 2

		the init_state will be 347618052
		(same goes to goal_state)

	2. goal_state
		the goal state of the 8 puzzle, from first digit at first row, first column
		(use 0 to represent blank)

	3. depth_limit
		the depth limit used by Depth First Search
		(0 means no depth limit)

	Examples of working initial state => goal state :

	1. 347618052 => 123804567 (with depth limit 20)
	2. 123045678 => 012345678 (with depth limit 45)
	3. 283164705 => 123804765 (with depth limit 5)
	4. 162573048 => 123456780 (with depth limit 25)
	5. 813402765 => 123456780 (with depth limit 32)
